IMPORTANT NOTICES AND DISCLAIMERS
PLEASE READ
During an emergency, softphone technology may not provide the most timely or accurate location data if used for a 911 emergency call. Calls may be misdirected to the wrong emergency response center or the emergency response center may make errors when determining your location. USE A SOFTPHONE ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK DURING AN EMERGENCY. Cisco will not be liable for resulting errors or delays.
